[h3]Summary[/h3]
"Mod Folder System" is designed to manage mods in folder system, making it convenient for players with a lot of mods subscribed.
Rightclick at the "Manage Mods" button to open the folder system.
Double-click a mod to toggle it (disable a mod when pressing Shift would also disable its redundant dependencies (dependencies that are not used by other enabled mods)), or a folder to enter (first you should create a folder using the button "Create Folder" below).
Rightclick and drag an item to move its position (when moving a mod into a folder, pressing shift to copy it). When at custom order, you can change the order of items; When at the folder system (not to show all mods), you can move an item in or out a folder (moving in a folder named ".." is equivalent to moving to the previous directory, or you can just move to a folder in the path).
When deleting an item, you should press Ctrl or Shift or both. Pressing Ctrl means unsubscribe (for folder it means unsubscribe all mods in the folder), just like the vanilla; Pressing Shift means delete the index, so the mod or mods in the folder would go back to the root. If you just unsubscribe but not delete the index, the item would still be there, and you can continue to manage its location, but you nned to resubscribe to enable it again.
Click a mod when pressing Alt to favor it. Favorite mods won't be disalbed due to "Enable & Disable" button, unless you press Ctrl at the same time.
This mod's data is saved in "ModFolderData.json" in the mod folder, please do not delete or modify it arbitrarily (if you want to modify it, please make a backup!)

- Delete is seperated into unsubscribe and delete the index. If a mod is unsubscribed but keep the index, it would still show in the directory, and player can easily resubscribe and install it. And if you delete the index but don't unsubscribe the mod, it would show up at the root folder if it don't has a copy anywhere else.

- Delete the folder behave similarly, but unsubscribe all is more dangerous, so double confirm is always needed by default.
